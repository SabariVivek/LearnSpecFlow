# Hooks :

	* Multiple prerequisites are required to start of test execution for most of the times.
	
	* Right from setting up the driver, browser settings to cookies, navigate to the specific URL etc.,

	* Similarly, some steps must be perfomed after executing test scenarios, 
			like quitting driver, 
			cleaning browser cookies,
			generating reports etc.,

	* Such cases can be easily handled using one particular type of Speckflow Annotations, namely SpecFlow Hooks.

	* Hooks can be used to perform additional automation logic at specific times.

	* It can be defined anywhere in project or step definition layers.

	* SpecFlow hooks annotations allow user to manager better code workflow and help in reducing code redundancy.

	* Hooks are global, but can be restricted to run only for features or scenarios by defining a scoped binding, 
			which can be filtered with tags.

	* The execution order of hooks for the same type is undefined, unless specified explicitly.

# Order of the hooks :

	* Lower number has the highest priority.
	
	* eg., 10 will execute before 20 or 11.

	* No restriction in numbers.
